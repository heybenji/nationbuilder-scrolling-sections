Example files and documentation for implementing immersive scrolling pages in NationBuilder.

## Implementing the theme changes

1. Upload the files in the _theme-files_ folder to your theme.
2. Modify your theme's existing files in the _theme-modifications_ folder according to the instructions in each file.

Once you've put the files in place, and modified _nav.html and layout.html in your template according to the instructions, you can create your very own immersive scrolling page.

## Creating a scrolling page in NationBuilder

It works by basically pulling in subpages as sections of a parent page, and hiding those subpages in the menu. So first you make the parent page and assign a special tag to it. Then you add additional sections as subpages. Finally, you reorder them as if they were in the menu using NationBuilder's concept of _Subnav pages._

1. Create a new page with a scrolling layout, go to the dashboard and click _+ New page,_ and choose _Basic page._
2. Once the page is created, click Settings in the horizontal tabs for the page (next to Content), and add the tag `Layout: Scrolling`.
3. Next click the Subpages tab and create a new subpage for each section that you want, and always leave the _Include in top nav_ option checked, as this is what allows you change the order in which the sections appear. 
4. Add a background. You add a background by selecting the _Settings_ tab for the subpage you’re editing, then the _Social media_ tab under that. Upload the image where it says _Thumbnail image for Facebook, etc._ and save.
5. Once you’ve got all your sections, it’s time to order them. Edit the parent page that you created in step 1, and choose _Subpages_ from it's tabbed menu and then choose _Subnav pages._ Drag them into the order you want. It should save the order automatically.
